**"Your primary goal is to extract, analyze, and visualize data from the provided Wikipedia URL.**

**1. Data Acquisition:**
   - **Target URL:** `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films`
   - **Action:** Fetch the HTML content from this URL.

**2. Data Extraction and Cleaning:**
   - **Parsing:** Use a web scraping library (e.g., BeautifulSoup) to locate and extract the main table containing the film data from the fetched HTML.
   - **DataFrame Conversion:** Convert the extracted table into a pandas DataFrame.
   - **Column Renaming:** Standardize column names for easier access, e.g., 'Worldwide gross' to 'Worldwide_gross', 'Year' to 'Year', 'Rank' to 'Rank', and 'Peak' to 'Peak'.
   - **Data Type Conversion:**
     - Convert the 'Worldwide_gross' column to a numeric data type by removing '$' and ',' characters.
     - Convert the 'Year' column to a numeric data type.
     - Convert the 'Rank' column to a numeric data type.
     - Convert the 'Peak' column to a numeric data type. This will likely involve extracting the numerical value from strings like "No. 1" (so "No. 1" becomes 1).
   - **Handling Missing Data:** Remove any rows with missing or non-numeric values in the 'Worldwide_gross', 'Year', or 'Rank' columns after conversion.

**3. Data Analysis and Calculation:**
   - **Question 1: $2 Billion Movies Before 2000:** Identify and count how many films had a 'Worldwide_gross' of $2,000,000,000 or more AND were released in a 'Year' before 2000.
   - **Question 2: Earliest $1.5 Billion Film:** Determine the title of the earliest film (based on 'Year') that grossed $1,500,000,000 or more.
   - **Question 3: Rank-Peak Correlation:** Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the 'Rank' and 'Peak' columns.

**4. Data Visualization:**
   - **Scatterplot:** Generate a scatterplot using 'Rank' on the x-axis and 'Peak' on the y-axis.
   - **Regression Line:** Add a dotted red regression line to the scatterplot to illustrate the relationship between 'Rank' and 'Peak'.
   - **Labels and Title:** Ensure the plot has appropriate axis labels ('Rank', 'Peak') and a clear title (e.g., 'Scatterplot of Rank vs. Peak with Regression Line').
   - **Image Output:** Save the generated plot as a PNG image in a base64 encoded data URI format. Ensure the image file size is under 100,000 bytes.

**5. Output Format:**
   - Present all answers in a JSON array. The array should contain:
     - The answer to Question 1 as a string (e.g., "Number of $2 billion movies released before 2000: [count]").
     - The answer to Question 2 as a string (e.g., "Earliest film that grossed over $1.5 billion: [film title]").
     - The answer to Question 3 as a string, formatted to two decimal places (e.g., "Correlation between Rank and Peak: [correlation value]").
     - The base64 encoded data URI string of the generated scatterplot.

**Example of Desired Output Structure:**

```json
[
  "Number of $2 billion movies released before 2000: [count]",
  "Earliest film that grossed over $1.5 billion: [film title]",
  "Correlation between Rank and Peak: [correlation value]",
  "data:image/png;base64,[base64_encoded_image_data]"
]
